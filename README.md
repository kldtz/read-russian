# Read Russian

This Chrome extension retrieves definitions and additional linguistic information for Russian words from the English Wiktionary and displays a short summary in a small, unintrusive pop-up window in the current tab.

## Installation

The extension is not released yet. To try it out, you need to [download the repository](https://github.com/kldtz/read-russian/archive/master.zip), unzip it, go to [chrome://extensions/](chrome://extensions/), switch on 'developer mode' (top right corner), click 'load unpacked' and select 'read-russian' under the root directory of the repository.

## Usage

Select a Russian word, open the context menu (right-click on the selection) and click on the new item 'Get info for ...'. A small pop-up window will appear at the top of the page.
