# Read Russian

This Chrome extension retrieves definitions and additional linguistic information for Russian words from the English Wiktionary and displays a short summary in a small, unintrusive pop-up window in the current tab.

## Installation

Install the extension via [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/read-russian/bfiedbggkbnefgngmdkhofddgpfjahcd).

## Usage

Select a Russian word, open the context menu (right-click on the selection) and click on the new item 'Get info for ...'. A small pop-up window will appear at the top of the page.

Click on a translation in the pop-up window to add it as a flashcard to Chrome's local storage. To export all your collected flashcards in CSV format, click on the toolbar icon (upper-right corner) and choose _Export Flashcards_.
